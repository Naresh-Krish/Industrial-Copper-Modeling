# Industrial-Copper-Modeling

# Introduction:
The copper industry, while dealing with relatively straightforward sales and pricing data, encounters challenges due to skewed and noisy data. These challenges can undermine the precision of manual predictions, leading to suboptimal pricing decisions. Manual handling of such complexities is not only time-intensive but also may not yield the desired pricing accuracy. To address these issues, the application of machine learning regression models becomes paramount. By harnessing advanced methodologies like data normalization, feature scaling, and outlier detection, and leveraging algorithms designed to handle skewed and noisy data, the copper industry can significantly enhance the accuracy and efficiency of its pricing predictions.

Another significant challenge for the copper industry lies in lead capturing. The process of evaluating and classifying leads based on their potential to become customers is crucial. A lead classification model offers a systematic approach to accomplish this. By utilizing the 'STATUS' variable, where 'WON' signifies success and 'LOST' represents failure, data points beyond these statuses are eliminated. This approach streamlines the lead classification process, ensuring that the focus is on leads with the highest likelihood of conversion.

# Tools:
For addressing the challenges mentioned above and creating an effective solution, the following tools and techniques will be employed:

# 1. Python Programming:
Python will serve as the primary programming language for data manipulation, preprocessing, model building, and creating the Streamlit application.

# 2. Pandas and NumPy: 
These libraries will be used for data manipulation, handling missing values, and transforming data into suitable formats.

# 3. Scikit-Learn: 
This machine learning library will facilitate the implementation of regression and classification models, along with data preprocessing and evaluation.

# 4. Data Visualization Libraries: 
Tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn will be utilized for data visualization, aiding in understanding data distribution and patterns.

# 5. Streamlit: 
Streamlit will be employed to create an interactive web application that allows users to input data and receive predicted selling prices or lead statuses in real-time.

# Procedure:
The solution to the challenges faced by the copper industry involves a systematic approach:

# 1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
   - Analyze the dataset to understand its structure, features, and characteristics.
   - Identify and handle issues such as skewness and noisy data.
   - Clean and preprocess the dataset, addressing missing values and outliers.

# 2. Regression Model Development:
   - Select an appropriate regression algorithm (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression).
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Train the regression model on the training data and fine-tune hyperparameters.
   - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE).

# 3. Classification Model Development:
   - Filter the dataset to include only 'WON' and 'LOST' statuses for lead classification.
   - Choose a suitable classification algorithm (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier).
   - Split the dataset and train the classification model.
   - Assess the model's accuracy using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

# 4. Streamlit Application Creation:
   - Develop a Streamlit web application with user-friendly input fields.
   - Integrate the trained regression and classification models into the application.
   - Create the functionality to predict selling prices or lead statuses based on user inputs.

# 5. Validation and Testing:
   - Validate the models and application using sample data inputs.
   - Ensure that predictions align with manually calculated results.

# 6. Documentation and Deployment:
   - Create comprehensive documentation detailing data preprocessing, model selection, and application usage.
   - Package the code, models, and documentation for deployment.
   - Deploy the Streamlit application on a suitable platform for user access.

Through these steps, the solution aims to provide the copper industry with a data-driven approach to enhance pricing decisions and lead capturing processes, ultimately contributing to improved profitability and customer conversion rates.
